This is an Angular Blog application. Has capabilities of basic viewing posts,
editing and deleting post(s), a navbar (header).

This is a somewhat lightweight project to wrap my head around Angular.
Concepts such as Routing, Data Binding(String interpolation and Property Binding),
Safe Navigation Operators, Routing, Services as such are covered simply.
